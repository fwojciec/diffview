{"id":"diffview-373","title":"Research: Narrative components and ordering for code review storytelling","description":"## Problem\n\nThe current narrative types and role orderings were defined ad-hoc. We need principled guidelines for:\n1. Which roles/components belong in each narrative type\n2. How to order them for effective code review storytelling\n3. When the LLM classifier should choose each narrative\n4. **What primitives beyond diff hunks might improve storytelling**\n\nCurrent state (from diffview-imi):\n- 5 narratives: cause-effect, core-periphery, before-after, rule-instances, entry-implementation\n- 9 roles: problem, fix, test, core, supporting, rule, exception, integration, cleanup\n- Orderings defined but not validated against storytelling principles\n- **Only primitive: diff hunks** - no \"before\" snapshots, no commit progression\n\n## Deliverables\n\n### 1. Design DeepResearch Query\n\nCreate a query that explores:\n- **Narrative theory**: How do existing storytelling frameworks (Freytag's pyramid, hero's journey, etc.) map to code review contexts?\n- **Code review research**: What does research say about effective code review comprehension?\n- **Diff presentation**: How do existing diff tools (GitHub, Gerrit, Reviewable) organize changes?\n- **Our implementation**: Given our 5 narratives and 9 roles, what's missing or redundant?\n- **Storytelling primitives**: What information beyond diff hunks would improve comprehension?\n\nThe query should reference:\n- This codebase's current implementation (classification.go, gemini/classifier.go prompt)\n- The narrative types and their intended use cases\n- The role enum and current orderings\n\n### 2. Research: Primitives Beyond Diff Hunks\n\nInvestigate whether effective storytelling needs more than hunks:\n\n**Potential primitives to evaluate:**\n- **Before snapshots**: Full file state before changes (not just diff). Could make \"before-after\" narrative more compelling by showing complete \"before\" context\n- **Commit progression**: For multi-commit PRs, the sequence of changes might tell a better story than the squashed diff\n- **Unchanged context**: Code that wasn't modified but is relevant to understanding the change (callers, related functions)\n- **Test output**: Actual test results showing behavior change\n- **Type information**: Function signatures, interfaces that constrain the change\n\n**Available data sources:**\n- Git history (commit messages, individual commits, blame)\n- File contents at any revision\n- PR metadata (description, comments, reviews)\n\n**Questions to answer:**\n- Which primitives have highest value-to-complexity ratio?\n- How would the classifier schema change to accommodate them?\n- What's the UX for presenting non-hunk primitives in the viewer?\n\n### 3. Synthesize Findings\n\nAfter running DeepResearch, document:\n- Validated/revised narrative types with clear definitions\n- Role inventory: keep, rename, add, or remove\n- Ordering principles (not just lists, but WHY each order works)\n- Classification guidelines: decision tree for choosing narrative type\n- **Primitive recommendations**: which additional primitives to implement, if any\n\n### 4. Create Implementation Tasks\n\nBreak findings into actionable issues:\n- Schema changes (if roles change)\n- Ordering changes (if needed)\n- Prompt updates (classifier instructions)\n- Documentation updates\n- **New primitive support** (if recommended)\n\n## Entrypoints\n\n- `classification.go:82` - narrativeOrder function with current orderings\n- `gemini/classifier.go:154` - BuildClassificationPrompt with narrative descriptions\n- `gemini/classifier.go:242` - role enum in schema\n- `diffview.go` - Diff/Hunk types (current only primitives)\n- `classification.go:12` - ClassificationInput (has Commits[] but only uses messages)\n\n## Context for DeepResearch\n\nCurrent narrative definitions (from classifier prompt):\n- cause-effect: A problem leads to a fix (common for bugfixes)\n- core-periphery: Central change with supporting updates (common for features)\n- before-after: Transformation from old to new pattern (common for refactors)\n- rule-instances: A pattern applied in multiple places\n- entry-implementation: API/interface plus its implementation\n\nCurrent orderings (from classification.go):\n- cause-effect: problem → fix → test → supporting → cleanup\n- core-periphery: core → supporting → cleanup\n- before-after: cleanup → core → test → supporting\n- rule-instances: rule → exception → core → supporting → cleanup\n- entry-implementation: integration → core → test → supporting → cleanup\n\nCurrent data available but unused:\n- Full commit history (only first message used currently)\n- Git blame information\n- File contents at any revision\n- PR description/comments (not captured)\n\n## Validation\n\n- [ ] DeepResearch query designed and documented\n- [ ] Research executed and findings synthesized\n- [ ] Clear recommendations for each narrative type\n- [ ] Primitives evaluation completed with recommendations\n- [ ] Implementation issues created with specific changes","notes":"COMPLETED: Research on narrative components and ordering\n\n## Key Findings\n\n1. **Narrative improves recall**: Story-view format shows 16% better recall, 30% less error vs list-view (IEEE study)\n\n2. **File ordering matters**: Code Diff ordering (by lines changed) outperforms alphabetical; files shown first get more reviewer attention (primacy effect)\n\n3. **Cognitive load**: ~7±2 items in working memory; progressive disclosure helps\n\n4. **Three-act structure maps to code review**:\n   - Exposition (problem/context)\n   - Confrontation (the change)\n   - Resolution (tests/validation)\n\n## Implementation Issues Created\n\nSchema Refinements (P3):\n- diffview-zip: Rename 'integration' → 'interface'\n- diffview-m2y: Rename 'rule' → 'pattern'\n- diffview-xyc: Merge 'exception' into 'supporting'\n- diffview-yvt: Fix before-after ordering (tests last)\n\nEnhanced Classification (P2):\n- diffview-3i7: Add PR metadata fields\n- diffview-a5h: Update prompt with narrative theory\n\nFuture Work (P2-P3):\n- diffview-aep: Design commit progression primitive\n- diffview-aka: Evaluate rule-instances narrative\n\n## Primitives Recommendation\n\n1. **Commit progression**: HIGH priority - shows evolution\n2. **PR description**: HIGH priority - author intent\n3. **Before snapshots**: MAYBE - only for before-after\n4. **Others**: NO - complexity outweighs value\n\n## Documentation\n\nFull research in: docs/narrative-components-research.md","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-28T14:28:00.675978-08:00","created_by":"filip","updated_at":"2025-12-28T15:06:35.133695-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-28T15:01:03.395719-08:00","close_reason":"Closed"}

NO_COLOR is respected (verified via testing)\n\n### Why No Code Changes Needed\nThe architecture already achieves graceful degradation:\n- Palette stores hex colors (`diffview.Color`)\n- Lipgloss rendering calls `lipgloss.Color()` with those hex values\n- termenv (inside lipgloss) converts to terminal's capability level\n\n### Validation Criteria Met\n- ✅ Works in true color terminal (hex colors pass through)\n- ✅ Degrades gracefully in 256-color terminal (lipgloss auto-converts)\n- ✅ make validate passes","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2025-12-24T20:16:02.798026-08:00","updated_at":"2025-12-26T11:52:45.17086-08:00","closed_at":"2025-12-26T11:52:45.17086-08:00","close_reason":"No code changes needed.
